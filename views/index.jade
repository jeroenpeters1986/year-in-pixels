      h3 Welcome to Year in Pixels
      p This tool was made to keep track of your mood during the entire year, using pixels. You can load this page every day and select how you're feeling. The tool will keep track of your mood and give you a visual for how you've felt during the year.
      p This tool is very privacy minded, it doesn't use any cookies and doesn't track you in any way. The data is stored in your browser only and is not sent to any server. It has no Google Analytics or other social media trackers. Therefor, if you use different browsers or computers, you can import/export your calendar too.

      h3 About this version
      p
        | I was using Year In Pixels, but the tool of Alejandro seemed not to be maintained anymore and taken offline by the provider.
        | So I decided to update it so it could be deployed again. I also did some style enhancements, stripped all trackers and fixed the Quote of the Day.
